## Decoding:

At the bottom of the document, there are a few lines containing tabs and spaces:
``` 				 	     	  				      				 	     	    				   	   	       	 		 ```.

We encode the tabs as dashes, and the spaces as dots, that way we get a walid stream of Morse code:
```.____ _. ..._ .____ ... .____ _... ._.. .____ .._. ._.. ...._ __.```.

Finally, we use the [More Code's translator](https://morsecode.world/international/translator.html) and get the flag:
```1NV1S1BL1FL4G```
