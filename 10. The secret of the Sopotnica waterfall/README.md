## Description and resources

### Mission brief
Sopotnica Waterfalls, situated on the slopes of Jadovnik mountain in Southwestern Serbia, are caused by а vertical drop in the course of the river Sopotnica as it races its way to the mountain’s base. The river itself is formed by several permanent and intermittent springs; after a stretch where all water follows the same course, it branches again creating separate watercourses that race down the mountain’s sides, each branch with its own waterfalls. As you approach the waterfalls on the river Sopotnica, you will see absolutely no hint of the splendid natural treasure you are about to discover. On the narrow dirt road, which can only be traversed on foot, you will hear the mighty hum of the Sopotnica beckoning you, eager to present to you its waterfalls in all their glory. This postcard from Sopotnica in addition to the natural beauty it depicts, it also hides some other secret. Find it...
