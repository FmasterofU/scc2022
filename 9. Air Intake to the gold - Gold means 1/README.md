## Description and resources

### Mission brief
**Steganography: The root "steganos" comes from the Greek "hidden" and "graph" for "to write". Literally, this means "hidden writing".** As the main purpose is to hide a secret inside something that is not a secret, let's see how it works.

It has been used for centuries, but these days, hackers and IT people have digitized this word. As steganography is the tale of Man and Machine, we decided to offer you a picture that shows also a similar tale. Watch as Max Verstappen, the RB7, and Alpine Ski Racer Aksel Lund Svindal meet up for a showdown in Kitzb√ºhel as they take on the famous Streif. See the tale [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gkwoK0EfKdc). If the pinnacle of motorsport met the pinnacle of winter sports, how do you compare between Formula 1 at the Red Bull Ring in Austria and the World Cup downhill on the Streif? Speed, g-forces, track record, or height differences - there are plenty of similarities...

### Instructions
The picture describes the essence of competition and the beauty of Austria, the home of Red Bull. Would you be creative enough to discover the flag hidden in this shot?
