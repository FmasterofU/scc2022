## Hints
Because our challenges do not all have the same amount of hints, our deduction system is based on the % of hints used. If a challenge has 4 hints, each hint is worth 25%. If you use the complete solution, you get 0 points.

1. Where should I start? (-25%)

When accessing a web page a simple CMS will be displayed. The challenge is to login as an admin user so we can start posting new articles. By clicking on the login button, a login form will be presented.

2. First idea (-25%)

Try to bypass the authentication on the web. The first approach is usually testing for a SQL injection code vulnerability. SQL injection is a technique through which attackers can execute their own malicious SQL statements, generally referred to as a malicious payload. Through the malicious SQL statements, attackers can gain access to or steal information from the victimâ€™s database, or even worse, they may be able to make changes to the database.

3. Trying something simple (-25%)

There are situations in real life when programmers just use user input and simple concatenation to make SQL query strings.
For example:

```$query="select * from users where username='". $username ."' and password='". $password ."';"```
By setting the value of $username to:

```admin';-- -```
the SQL query string becomes:

```select * from users where username='admin'; -- - and password='anythin';```
This way, we select the data where username is admin and everything else is commented out ("--").

4. Complete solution (-100%)

By entering:

```admin';-- -```
in the username field and anything in the password field, we can successfully log in.

# Lessons learned:

Code which is vulnerable to SQL injections can be very dangerous.
Developers should be aware of this and implement the appropriate techniques to avoid this vulnerability.
TL;DR Every user input should be checked and sanitized.
