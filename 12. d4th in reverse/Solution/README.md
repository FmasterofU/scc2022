## Method

When we list all strings present in the file by use of `strings d4th_reverse`, we get:
```
datetimeZ
charray
print
./d4th_reverse.py
<module>
```
...which indicates the presence of a python script inside. Now we run the file as a python script wih command `python3 d4th_reverse`, and get the following output:
```r3v3rs3f14g```
